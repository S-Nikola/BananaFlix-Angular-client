<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 BananaFlix-Angular-client <a name="about-project"></a>

> **BananaFlix** is the client side of a movie browsing app, made with Angular and designed with Angular-Material. It allows users to register, log in and browse through movies. They can add movies to their list of favorites and they can view their profile details and edit them as they wish. The purpose of the project was to learn Angular as part of the CareerFoundry curriculum. It is part of a larger full-stack project and one of two clients (the other made with React) using the same backend.
